<p> Sometimes, when I get bored I like to write stories. It helps me get away from the stress of school and lets me defy the laws of the universe(lol). I mostly write 1st person and 3rd person limited romance fiction, but sometimes I'll step out of my comfort zone and write in 2nd person. I'll never write non-fiction, too boring. I'm writing a book right now that's based off one of my favorite novels, but with my OCs. I guess you could call it a fanfic, but I see it as a book. I'm also part of the Free Writers Club. It's just a place you go to write about stuff.
