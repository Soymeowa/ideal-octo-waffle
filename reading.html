<p> The last thing I will be sharing with you is reading. Yes, yes, some may call it boring; and reading <i>is</i> technically just looking at the remains of a ground up tree and hallucinating, but I love it nonetheless. I like all finds of fiction, but Victorian era paranormal horror with a dash of LGBT+ romance will forever have a special place in my heart. To all you non-fiction lovers, I'll admit, reading autobiographies and biographies is cool, but still subpar. Recently, I've gotten into reading books online instead of a physical copies due to two reasons: COVID and laziness. I just don't have the time or energy to beg my parents to drive all the way to the library and have them stick around until near closing time, so I got into the habit of searching "read <i>book name</i> online free" into the Chrome search bar. I'll also download pdfs of these books when I want to read something offine, like on the bus or during a trip. A good site to use is <a href="https://u1lib.org/">u1lib.org</a>. If you want to know if I've ever read <i>those books</i> (don't lie, you know what I mean), I shamefully admit, yes. I've collected an entire series of them, actually. Not my proudest moment, but hey, we gotta do what we gotta do.
<br>
<br>
Here's a list of <i>those</i> books in case you all are curious (and I know you are):
<br>
(btw the first three are the series I told you about)
<ul>
<li>The Sweetest Oblivion</li>
<li>The Maddest Obsession</li>
<li>Te Darkest Temptation</li>
<li>Mo Dao Zu Shi, specifically the extras and one scene (I'm not telling you, you gotta look through the book yourself if you're <i>this</i> interested)</li>
